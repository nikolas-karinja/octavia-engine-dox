# Say Hello to Octavia
 
Have you ever been fond of the idea of developing 3D games in JavaScript? Are you familiar with the frameworks called React and Three.js? If that's the case, this would be the package for you! Octavia is an Entity-Component System based engine compiled into a React-friendly NPM package.

## The Mission
I want to make 3D game development easier for people who love JavaScript and like doing everything from scratch. This engine gives you that "foot in the door" that you need to enjoy the development process.


### Background
I've had a passion for making games since I was 10 years old. Wether that be stategy board games or First-Person shooters in Unreal, the craft has been part of my core being. I discovered JavaScript at 12 and ever since it has been my favorite language. For all of us web developers out there, creating programs and sites with it is dream-like compared to other languages. Ever since I discovered the language, I've always tried to make games with it. The problem is the larger the scale of the project, the longer it takes to develop the underlying systems that allow the game to run. I ran into this problem more times than I'd like to admit, so I created Octavia to solve it. Initially I made it for just me, but I figured the world could have a fun time with it too.
