# A Lovely Little Friend
These are the templates in-which Game Objects are based on. Clones do have value you know..

## A Simple Assembly
They can be very lengthy and complex. But since we only have one custom component, we can make this ver simple.

<Steps>
### Creation
In the same folder called ```core``` that we just created, let's make a new file named ```assemblies.js``` and paste the code below in the file.

```js filename="src/core/assemblies.js"
export const ASSEMBLIES = {
    "My Cube": {
        gameScene: "Main",
        components: {
            "Cube Mesh" : {}
            /* More components can be added here */
        }
    }
}
```

### What Did We Do?
That is our first Assembly! Simple huh. Let's break it down. 

```"My Cube"``` is the name of the assembly. The value of the property ```gameScene``` is a string representing the name of the Game Scene in which the GO will be stored. The property ```components``` is an object that holds the name and options of the components this GO will utilize. ```"Cube Mesh"``` is the name of our stored component (if you remember). For future reference, the initial option values for components go within those curly brackets (the value of the ```"Cube Mesh"``` property).
</Steps>

Now let's put a Game Object out into the world...
