# Programmers, ASSEMBLE!
Now we will store our components and assemblies within Octavia so we can see our first Game Object!

## Back To React
Everything we store will be within Octavia's interface.

<Steps>
### Storing Our Data
Let's go back to the file ```src/Octavia.jsx``` and add some "props" to the interface. The new code looks like this:

```js filename="src/Octavia.jsx"
import { OCTAVIA } from "@little-island/octavia-engine"
import { COMPONENTS } from "./core/components"
import { ASSEMBLIES } from "./core/assemblies"

const Octavia = ({children}) =>
{
    return <OCTAVIA.Interface
        data={{
            assemblies : ASSEMBLIES,
            components : COMPONENTS,
        }}
        onReady={() =>
        {
            OCTAVIA.AssembleGameObject("My Cube")
        }}>
        {children}
        </OCTAVIA.Interface>
}

export default Octavia
```

### What Did We Do?
We stored our assemblies and components within the interface along with adding an action for when Octavia is loaded and ready. The ```onReady``` prop's value should be a function. Whatever is in that function will be called when the engine has loaded all necessary data (a.k.a. Octavia is ready). 

In our case we are just assembling a GO based off the assembly we made earlier.

### Seeing The Results
If you haven't already and your project is based on the ```create-react-app``` template, enter this into the shell within your project's root directory:

```shell
npm start
```

Once your program is visible and ready in the browser, you should see something similar to what's depicted below on screen.
<br />
<Image src={sc_readySetAction} alt="Ready Set Action!" />

Congratulations. You have successfully created your first Game Object! That's the basic principal behind creating things in Octavia. But where is the detail? Let's move on shall we...
