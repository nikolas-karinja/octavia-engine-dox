# Implementation
To use Octavia, you can install it using NPM since it's a package. It's meant to be used alongside React for UI and Three.js for graphics.

## Quick Start
Here is the simplest way to implement Octavia into your existing React project.

<Steps>
### Install
In your project directory, run the following command to install the dependencies

```shellscript
npm i --save three @little-island/octavia-engine
```
Add the following scripts in ```package.json```

```json filename="package.json"
"scripts": {
    "update-three": "npm uninstall --save three && npm i --save three",
    "update-engine": "npm uninstall --save @little-island/octavia-engine && npm i --save @little-island/octavia-engine"
},
```

### Creating the React Component
Assuming you used the ```create-react-app``` package to create your project, you can create a new Component. It will be created under ```src/Octavia.jsx```.

```jsx filename="src/Octavia.jsx"
import { OCTAVIA } from "@little-island/octavia-engine"

const Octavia = ({children}) =>
{
    return <OCTAVIA.Interface>
        {children}
        </OCTAVIA.Interface>
}

export default Octavia
```

Then in the file ```src/App.jsx``` replace the code with the code below.

```jsx filename="src/App.jsx"
import './App.css';
import Octavia from './Octavia';

const App = () => 
{
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <Octavia>
            {/* All of your program's react components you
            want to see in-game go here */}
            </Octavia>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

Now your program is ready to start.

### Starting the Program
You start it up just like you would with ```create-react-app``` template.

```shellscript
npm start
```

Once the program is in view on your browser, press the ```F2``` key to view the Octavia's interface. Hold down the left-mouse button ```LMB``` and drag the mouse around. You should see something similar to what is pictured below.

<Image src={sc_firstInterfaceLook} alt="First interface look" />
</Steps>

Now Octavia has officially been integrated into your program. Now let's try to understand as best we can how Octavia works "under the hood"...
